###What worked

I definitely understand callbacks more after doing this lab and understand the flow of information through props between components. 

###What didn't work for me 

I am a little confused about the component lifecycle and the times where props are actually updated. I'm confused about the difference between this.props and props. in a componentwillrecieveprops function. 

###Extra Credit

The app supports multiple boards.
